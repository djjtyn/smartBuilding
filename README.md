# SmartBuilding

## Project developed for Distributed Systems module of NCI Software Development HND course.

### Project Brief
Assume that you lead a Software Development Consultancy company which has been commissioned to create an application ofr a Smart Building. 

As part of your task you have to develop a set of protocols/messages and build a reference implementation that simulates the operations of a smart automated building environment. 
As a result, your smart building could consist of smart services and devices that inter-communicate with each other.

Your devices/services must publish themselves and discover each other. Your devices/services should communicate via gRPC.

You should begin by devising your own scenario. There must be a minimum of 3 separate services that would simulate the operations of the smart-automated environment. 

Finally, to demonstrate your implementation a simple client GUI should be developed, operating as a main controller that discovers and uses your devices/services
